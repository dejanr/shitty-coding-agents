# Shitty Coding Agents

Run with:

```bash
demo-it start .
```

```demo-it
title: Intro
slide: slides/01-intro.md
```

```demo-it
title: Agenda
slide: slides/02-agenda.md
speaker_notes: |
  Briefly walk through the journey: foundations, tools, loop, live demo,
  and the long-term improvement mindset.
```

```demo-it
title: LLM History + Recap
slide: slides/03-llm-history-and-recap.md
speaker_notes: |
  Looking back at how this all started and where are we today.
  And why I am so excited about it; it is only in recent months that this
  really started working reliably.
```

```demo-it
title: Tool Calling
slide: slides/04-tool-calling.md
speaker_notes: |
  Emphasize the key point: without tool calling, it is mostly chat.
  With tools, the model can perform useful work. Leverage environment and learn on the go.
  Not limited anymore by training data at a fixed point in time.
```

```demo-it
title: Agent Loop
slide: slides/05-agent-loop.md
speaker_notes: |
  Walk through the loop: prompt, plan, execute tools, observe result, and repeat until done.
```

```demo-it
title: MCP, Skills, Custom Tools
slide: slides/06-mcp-skills-tools.md
speaker_notes: |
  Explain the capability stack: MCP for integrations, skills for reusable workflows,
  and custom tools for project-specific actions.
```

```demo-it
title: Coding Agents
slide: slides/07-coding-agents.md
speaker_notes: |
  Position coding agents as software-native agents with file, shell, git,
  and browser capabilities.
```

```demo-it
title: AGENTS.md
slide: slides/08-agents.md
speaker_notes: |
  Highlight why AGENTS.md matters: persistent project guidance that shapes
  behavior across sessions and models.
```

```demo-it
title: Human in the Loop
slide: slides/09-human-in-the-loop.md
speaker_notes: |
  Clarify roles: humans provide direction and quality judgment,
  agents provide speed and execution.
```

```demo-it
title: Live Demo (TV Show Research and Tracking)
slide: slides/10-demo.md
speaker_notes: |
  Set expectations for the demo flow: create tracker, update progress,
  extract a reusable skill, and validate with fresh context.
```

```demo-it
title: Kaizen
slide: slides/11-kaizen.md
speaker_notes: |
  Connect kaizen to agent workflows: small improvements compound,
  turning one-off prompts into better long-term systems.
```

```demo-it
title: Personal Environments
slide: slides/12-personal-environments.md
speaker_notes: |
  Reinforce that environment design is a leverage point:
  better setup leads to compounded gains.
```

```demo-it
title: Coding Agents as Personal Assistants
slide: slides/13-coding-agents-as-personal-assistants.md
speaker_notes: |
  Contrast generic agent behavior with personalized agent behavior:
  your AGENTS.md, skills, and patterns create compounding advantage.
```

```demo-it
title: Closing
slide: slides/14-closing.md
speaker_notes: |
  End with the core message: do not just use coding agents;
  build a system that improves with you.
```
