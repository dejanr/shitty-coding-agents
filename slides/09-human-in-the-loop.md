# Human in the loop

- Researching and creating a specification
- Steering the Model in the right direction
- Reviewing changes and iterating with the Model
- Reflecting on, and improving environment for humans and agents
- What really matters? Fundamentals
- Don't give too much context to Models. They get drunk
- Dumb zone, compaction, context management
