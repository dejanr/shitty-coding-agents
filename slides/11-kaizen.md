# Kaizen (改善)

**Literal meaning:** 改 (kai) = change, 善 (zen) = good → "change for better"

## Core Idea

Continuous improvement through **small, incremental steps** rather than big transformations.
It originated in Japanese manufacturing (especially Toyota) after WWII.

## Key Principles

- **Genchi Genbutsu** (現地現物) | "Go and see" - understand reality firsthand before making decisions
- **Small steps** Tiny improvements daily beat big changes rarely
- **Everyone improves** Not just managers - the person doing the work knows best
- **Respect for people** Systems adapt to humans, not the other way around
- **Eliminate waste** Remove what doesn't add value
